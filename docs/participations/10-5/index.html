        a) How familiar are you with JavaScript?
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm new to JavaScript. But based on
                research, it seems the language is
                frowned upon.
            </li>
        </ul>
        b) Was there anything we talked about today
        that you found surprising about JavaScript?
        If so, what? If not, is there something you
        are looking forward to learning about
        JavaScript?</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The language seems pretty flexible.
                No wonder the meme above is accurate.
            </li>
        </ul>
